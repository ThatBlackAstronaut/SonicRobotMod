# Sonic Robot Mod

Mod that replaces the robot gamemode (globally, in any level) with a working sprite animation of ***Sonic The Hedgehog***!

The mod's settings contain a selection of a bunch of different sprites from a lot of games, like Sonic 1, 2, 3, Mania, even some from fangames!
You can access the settings via the mod page or via the game's pause menu.

Use **High Graphics** for best visual results!

## Known issues

- Dying repeatedly with very little time in-between deaths can cause sonic to show up even when he shouldn't.
- Low graphics look bad - i can't and don't wanna bother with MANUALLY porting the sheets, sorry.
- Ghost trail shows normal robot sprite - will add an option to remove it entirely in robot gamemode later.
